RegressionSteps
===============

The three functions explained below work together to explore and present further actions and possibilities of linear regression models. My goal is to help users experiment with the explanatory variables of a linear regression model. As a result, these experiments will help the user reach conclusions about how the initial dependent variable will change, if one of the explanatory variables is changed as wished.

This is part of my coursework in the module GIS and Science in the UCL Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (casa.ucl.ac.uk)
